# Nash Q Learning 

Simple implementation of the Nash Q Learning  algorithm to solve games with two agents, as seen in the course Multiagent Systems at Politecnico di Milano. 
The Nash Q Learning algorithm was introduced in the paper [**Nash q-learning for general-sum stochastic games**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/945365.964288) (2003).
